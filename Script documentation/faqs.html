                                                1. The upload folder has no write rights

                                            Sometimes it happens, so you have a system (ffmpeg) installed on your server and it conflicts with the one that comes with this script, it crashes, in such case we recommend that you use the one that is installed on your server. You can specify the path to the binary file in the Admin panel -> Settings -> FFMPEG binary. As shown below
                                        </p>

                                            If your server already has system (ffmpeg) installed as we said, then just specify the path to it in this field

                                            This problem occurs due to the SMTP settings, for example, the wrong port number or the type of encryption.

                                            After making sure that your SMTP credentials as hostname username and password are correct, try the following options

                                                1. Try using TLS with 587

                                            For simplicity, we have divided all parts of this project into conditional parts that we call applications. <br>
                                            Each of which has its own separate styles, JS code, PHP code and everything that it needs to function

                                            For example, the home page is an application, the profile page is an application, the error page is also an application, and they all have separate dependencies that I mentioned above

                                            It is important to note that ads will not be shown if the user's wallet does not have sufficient funds.

                                        If you have missed one or two or v1.x.x updates,

                                        you have to update your site version by version manually. E.g.
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            Before you apply the latest updates to your site, 
                                            you must install previous updates, more precisely, 
                                            all versions of the update, from your current version to the latest version. 
                                            For example, your current version is: <b>[v1.0]</b>, and the latest version of the script is: <b>[v1.0.4]</b>,
                                            in such cases, you must install these previous versions <b>(v1.0.1, v1.0.2, v1.0.3)</b>, before installing the latest version <b>[v1.0.4]</b>
